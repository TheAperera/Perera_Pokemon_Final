# Perera_Pokemon_Final
Final Project for Data Wrangling and Exploratory Analysis with Dr. Shi
@Florida Polytechnic University 

This project is an analysis of the dataset from Kaggle called Pokemon with Stats found at this link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/abcsds/pokemon

Notice: This is an .ipynb file and runs on both Jupyter and Google Collab, this was programmed on Google Collab, but there are some unique Jupyter related issues with some plots as it doesn't identify some syntax the way it does in GC. I've included screenshots of successful plots as well from GC to ensure they work. 

In this project I explore and prepared a presentation of my findings and analysis. I had fun doing data analysis and exploration since the hours melted away when 
I was so busy with working on it. 

My four main questions began with understanding the Competitive scene of Pokemon Video Game Tournaments.
1) Addressing the reoccuring 'Cute Electric Mouse'/Pikachu-Esque Pokemon and how one of them was utilized in 2014 to take the Championship, are they valuable competively?
2) Starter Advantage between the generations 1 through 6, which Pokemon would really be the best starter amongst them? Often it's a choice that leads to competition.
3) What's the difference between casual players and the competitive players? What about someone who has an idea of what they're doing?
4) Champion vs Runner Ups (2014 and 2015), what were the differences that led to victory and loss? Was it down to the stats, or maybe it was strategy?

I've spent time watching the recorded Pokmeon VGT Championships of 2014 and 2015 as well to familiarize myself with how that Esports scene is run.
